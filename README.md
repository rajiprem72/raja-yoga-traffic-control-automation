# Raja Yoga Traffic Control Song Automation

This project automates the playback and sharing of Raja Yoga Traffic Control songs and hourly remembrance songs, helping Raja Yogis remember Paramathma throughout the day.

## Purpose
- To remind Raja Yogis at key times of the day with 3-minute Traffic Control songs.
- To send a 1-minute remembrance song every hour.
- To automate the process using the "Auto Text" mobile app for broadcasting songs from a YouTube playlist to WhatsApp groups and channels.

## Traffic Control Song Timings
The 3-minute Traffic Control songs are played daily at:
- 3:30 AM
- 5:45 AM
- 7:00 AM
- 10:30 AM
- 12:00 PM (Noon)
- 5:30 PM
- 7:30 PM
- 9:30 PM

## Hourly Remembrance Song
- A 1-minute remembrance song is played **every hour** from **4:00 AM to 10:00 PM**.
- Not played 24/7 to ensure focused remembrance during active hours.

## Features
